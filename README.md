# Radarr Ansible role

This is an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) role which installs [Radarr](https://radarr.video/) to run as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container wrapped in a systemd service.

This role *implicitly* depends on:

- [`com.devture.ansible.role.playbook_help`](https://github.com/devture/com.devture.ansible.role.playbook_help)
- [`com.devture.ansible.role.systemd_docker_base`](https://github.com/devture/com.devture.ansible.role.systemd_docker_base)

Check [`defaults/main.yml`](defaults/main.yml) for the full list of supported options. Refer to [this page](docs/configuring-radarr.md) for details about setting up the service with this role.

💡 For an Ansible playbook which integrates this role and makes it easier to use, see the [Mother-of-All-Self-Hosting Ansible playbook](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook).

## Limitations

> [!WARNING]
> A freshly installed Radarr has no authentication of its own (`AuthenticationMethod` is `None` in the `config.xml` it writes for itself), and this role does not add any. Radarr also serves its API key to unauthenticated callers on `/initialize.json`, and that key is enough to drive the whole API. Turn authentication on under *Settings -> General -> Security* in Radarr itself, or put a middleware in front of it through `radarr_container_labels_additional_labels`, before making an installation reachable from the internet.

The API key lives in `config.xml` under `radarr_data_path` (`/radarr/data/config.xml` by default). Radarr creates that file itself, with mode `0644`; the directory around it is created by this role with mode `0750` and owned by `radarr_uid`:`radarr_gid`, so the key is not readable by other users on the host.

This role configures Radarr with security in mind by doing the following:

1. Running the container as a non-root user
2. Making the filesystem read-only
3. Dropping most capabilities

Unfortunately, due to upstream requirements, some admissions had to be made:

1. Several capabilities related to permissions are added to the container
   - SETUID
   - SETGID
   - CHOWN
   - FOWNER
   - DAC_OVERRIDE
2. A `tmpfs` volume is mounted with `exec` permissions

You can read more about these upstream requirements in the documentation:

1. <https://docs.linuxserver.io/misc/non-root/>
2. <https://docs.linuxserver.io/misc/read-only/>

## Development

### pre-commit

You can optionally install a Git pre-commit hook (via [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) + [prek](https://prek.j178.dev/)) that runs formatting and linting checks before each commit. See [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](./.pre-commit-config.yaml) for which hooks are to be executed.

To install the hook, run the [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) command below:

```sh
just prek-install-git-pre-commit-hook
```

### Molecule

This role supports [Molecule](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/molecule/), an Ansible testing framework designed for developing and testing Ansible collections, playbooks, and roles.

Refer to [this page](./molecule/README.md) for details about how to utilize it.

### Releases

Tags are created by [`.github/workflows/autotag.yml`](.github/workflows/autotag.yml), which asks [`bin/compute-next-tag.sh`](bin/compute-next-tag.sh) what the commit on `main` should be released as. The answer comes from the Radarr version pinned in [`defaults/main.yml`](defaults/main.yml) and from the tags that already exist, so a commit that only touches documentation or CI is not released at all, and any change to the role itself is — without waiting for a dependency bump to carry it along.

[`bin/test-compute-next-tag.sh`](bin/test-compute-next-tag.sh) exercises that script against throwaway repositories, and runs as a prek hook.
